Useful maven archetypes which help speeding up development time and increase productivity. Feel free to use it and leave me a comment if any

### Jetty Archetype

Initiate an empty Dynamic Web 3.0 project backed by Jetty 9 Application Server. This package also includes scribe4j (my own package) that uses slf4j and log4j to write log message to Scribe (Log server developed by Facebook)

`scribe4j` may be found at [https://github.com/nmquyet/scribe4j.git]
